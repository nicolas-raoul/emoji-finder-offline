# Emoji Finder Offline

This Android application helps you find relevant emojis based on keywords.

## Current Features

*   **Keyword Input**: A text field at the top allows you to enter keywords. (Note: Keyword-based search functionality is not yet implemented).
*   **Emoji Display**: A static list of emojis (🗓️, ⏳, 👩‍💻, 😵‍💫, 🤯) is displayed in a grid.
*   **Copy to Clipboard**: Tapping on an emoji copies it to the clipboard and displays a "Copied to clipboard" notification.

## How to Build and Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the project in Android Studio.
3.  Let Gradle sync and download the necessary dependencies.
4.  Run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.

## Future Plans

*   Implement the core logic to search and display emojis dynamically based on the input keywords.
*   Potentially expand the emoji dataset.
*   UI/UX improvements.
